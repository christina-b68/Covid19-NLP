# Covid19-NLP
With the recent Covid-19 outbreaks, the world has gone into a state of emergency to fight against this pandemic. As we start practicing social distancing, many people start to work from home to lower the infection rate and thus, spending more time on social networks such as Twitters,etc... In this paper, we will investigate in: How did Twitter react to Covid-19? 
Covid-19, the pandemic that has infected millions of people and caused thousands of deaths in all over the world, has now become even more devastating to people in the USA. A lot of businesses have been negatively affected. The health care systems are struggling with the rapid increase of cases day by day. The shelter-in-place has been put into effect forcing people to stay home. The novel coronavirus has quickly spread across the country and has swept most parts of the world. Because of this, we’ve seen businesses and schools close, dramatic changes in commute and travel, increases in unemployment, etc. But we have also seen large support for first responders, communities coming together to support local businesses and provide for the elderly, larger presence of online resources, etc. With all the free time, people are also spending more time than ever on social media. The question posted here is how do people react to this pandemic? The purpose of this paper is to examine how Twitter users react to the pandemic. We will be looking at tweets with the hashtag #coronavirus, #coronavirusoutbreak, #coronavirusPandemic, #covid19, and #covid_19. We will identify and divide the tweets into positive and negative categories, determine the most frequently used words overall and in each category, and identify the topics in the documents. This will help us to understand the overall sentiment regarding Coronavirus and learn how people are impacted by the pandemic. The data set from Kaggle.com includes tweets created for the month of March in multiple csv files. There are 22 columns for each csv file with over 500,000 records.
